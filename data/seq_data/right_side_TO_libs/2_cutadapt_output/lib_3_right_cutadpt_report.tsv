WARNING: You specified a linked adapter as '-a ADAPTER1...ADAPTER2'. The
interpretation of what this means has changed in Cutadapt 2.0. (The 5'
adapter is now no longer anchored by default.) To get results consist
with the old behavior, you need to anchor the 5' adapter explicitly as
in '-a ^ADAPTER1...ADAPTER2'.
